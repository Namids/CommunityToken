# CommunityToken
The CommunityToken contract is a basic ERC20 token with additional functionality to allow businesses to register themselves and use tokens to transact on the platform as well as burning the token. The token is minted and sent by a user to another user as tip (for good works) which can then be used at a registered business to make purchase.
